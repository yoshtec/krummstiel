# Dickstiel

Dickstiel is a small software helping in the backup process of your apple ios device. 

# Name 
The name of the program was chosen to be an Apple that is under threat. 
One would assume that apples are ubiquitous and are in status "least concern", 
while this is true for many apples (especially for commercially used apples) there are many apple types that are 
endangered. 

The [Celler Dickstiel](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celler_Dickstiel) (sometimes also "Kr√ºgers Dickstiel") is an old 
apple variant which is on the "[Red list of endagered domestic plants](https://pgrdeu.genres.de/rlist)" of the German 
"[Federal Office for Agriculture and Food](https://www.ble.de/EN/Home/home_node.html)". It can roughly be translated 
to "thick stalk", which I found a good analogy for attaching the Apple device to thick usb cable.
